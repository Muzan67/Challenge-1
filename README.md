# Challenge-1

## Description

- My motivation for completing the assignment was to put in practice the tools and education that was given to me from my course. 
- The reason for building and completing this project is to start my path as a professional web developer. 
- We completed the request of the client which was to follow accessibility standards and in order to have their site optimized for performance. 
- I learn that style plays an integral role in bring to life the HTML page and having proper structure and clean code and combining the same 
CSS selectors and styles into one catergory makes it easier to read.  

## Installation

The code was already in place. I followed the Scout Rule Which was to clean up and organize the code. Updating the code to a better format and structure for the next developer or someone else who may want to look at my code.
